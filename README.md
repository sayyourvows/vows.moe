# vows.moe
my personal webbed site. made open source because i need to get over my fear of being Perceived.

the gnu affero general public license is applied in full to everything in this repository. however i would like to add that i will never bar anyone from taking inspiration of my site or using it to learn code. borrowing bits and pieces here and there or creating a similar layout is not what i added a copyright license for and frankly, how i learned a lot of code myself. i firmly believe that the internet is a place of sharing and community and learning. however copying my code exactly is something i am not comfortable with, nor am i comfortable with people copying my theming and such. in short: inspo is embraced, stealing my content is not. that is the purpose of the license :]
